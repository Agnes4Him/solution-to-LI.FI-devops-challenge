This task was approached using the following steps:

1. The original GitHub repository was forked into my GitHub account - public

2. This was cloned locally, and the APIs were built by running the Makefiles in each API directory using the command (ran from each directory):

```bash
make
```

3. The APIs were ran by running the binary file for each:

```bash
./getBird
```

```bash
./getBirdImage
```
